In this application, the MEAN stack was utilized to build a functional application. This includes MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. A single-page application (SPA) was used for a dynamic, highly-interactive environment. Express works great for fast initial application loading, while SPAs provide seamless updates without reloading the page. 
MongoDB is essential for storing data in a database. NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, are flexible, scalable, and integrate well with Javascript. 
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format used to structure data in a way that is easy to read and write for both humans and machiens. JSON uses a data format consisting of key-value pairs, while Javascript is a full-fledged programming language that is capable of logic and functions. 
In a full stack application, methods are used to interact with the backend. Common methods include Get, Post, Put, and Delete. Each method serves a distinct purpose in CRUD operations, enabling the frontend to interact with backend services through API endpoints. API endpoints are specific routes or URLs that correspond to the functionaly or resources of an application. Endpoints are mapped to controller functions on the server and enable clear communication paths between the client and server. Security is a vital consideration in full stack applications for protecting data, user privacy, and application integrity.
This course has helped me tie together all of the lessons I have learned throughout my degree program to learn how each piece of an application work together.
